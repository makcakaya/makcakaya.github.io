I had a Tatung computer back when I was 8 years old. It would load into MS-Dos and I would run Windows 3.1 or better Lotus: The Ultimate Challange. Everything was good and I was happy.

Now, we are developing applications, typicaly on Windows. I generally have following programs open during the day:

  - 2 instances of VS2013 with many plugins
  - a ConEmu window (love it) with multiple tabs and panes
  - a text editor like Notepad++ or lately Atom
  - multiple Windows Explorer windows
  - a database management tool (i.e. Sql Management Studio, Database.Net is a great tool)
  - services.msc window
  - SourceTree
  - an Outlook client
  - Chrome with many tabs
  - a few .pdf or Word documents
  - antivirus and firewall
  - and maybe even web server, emulator or virtual machine

It is not hard to guess that they demand a lot of computing and I/O resources. For now having less than 8 gb ram and an Intel quad-core processor is a suicide for a developer using this kind of a dev environment.
